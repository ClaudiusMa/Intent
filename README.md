## Project Intent
# Introduction:
I've often found myself losing sight of my goals whenever I unlock my iPhone, getting distracted by notifications and social media. Sometimes, I wake up my device without any clear intention, feeling as if my interactions are driven by the phone rather than my own choices. This experience sparked my interest in exploring how awareness of intent affects our interactions with technology.

# Central Question: 
How does awareness of intent affect the interaction between humans and technology?

# Project Objective: 
To develop an app that prompts users to record their intent each time they wake up their iPhone, aiming to foster intentional interaction and reduce distraction.

# Phase One: 
In the first phase, I will observe how consciously stating intentions influences users' interactions with digital devices. This involves assessing changes in habits, levels of distraction, and impacts on well-being. The goal is to determine if increased awareness reduces addictive tendencies and enhances user experience.

# Potential Next Steps: 
Future exploration may involve developing machine perception capabilities to further support user awareness and self-control, allowing technology to act as a copilot in achieving personal goals.
